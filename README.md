## 📖 About

- The app allows you to see the weather forecast in Toronto.
- The project was made using a scaled-down version of Clean Swift Architecture (VIP).
- Unit tests were made in the WeatherAppTests target, the project has 80,4% test coverage.
- I hardcoded Toronto location ID because I was time-constrained and could not add the search feature.
- To run the project clone this repository, open the WeatherApp folder and open the file WeatherApp.xcodeproj.
